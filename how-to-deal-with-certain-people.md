# How to deal with certain people

## When it comes to everyone...

No matter what, do not get in a fight with a customer, or any member of Ender Hosting. Always remember: 95% of the time, people only want to be heard. You just need to sit there and listen to what they have to say, and if the solution is something you are permitted to do, then do it. Even when the customer is not right, the customer is always right. The only time you can contradict the customer is when you have cold, hard facts that say otherwise \(like if they say that they did not close a ticket, but the bot logs say they did\)

## How to deal with spammers

Mute them.
